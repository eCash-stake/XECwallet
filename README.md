### How Is the eCash Network Secured?
In contrast to the Bitcoin Cash ABC (BCHA) network, which is secured using a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism, the developers of eCash plan to add proof-of-stake (PoS) in order to speed up transactions. What they term “Avalanche post-consensus” would see enhanced security and fork-free upgrades and allow for advanced opcodes thanks to enhanced script capability. The Avalanche layer will be added on top of the existing PoW in order to leverage the benefits of both.

**XEC is not an ERC-20 token, it is its own blockchain similar to Bitcoin (BTC).**

Avalanche is a revolutionary consensus algorithm that brings rock solid security, lightning fast speed, and dynamic capabilities to the eCash protocol.
